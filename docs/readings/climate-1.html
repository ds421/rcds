<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>

<p>Read through Part I: <a href="http://r4ds.had.co.nz/explore-intro.html">Data Exploration</a> (Chapters 2 - 8).  This looks like a lot of material, and it is, but your primary goal is only to familiarize yourself with what topics are covered where in the text.  Pay particular attention to Chapter 3 which introduces <code>ggplot2</code> (which may be familiar to many of you) and Chapter 5, which introduces five common <code>dplyr</code> functions we’ll be using.  Chapters 4, 6, and 8 cover are short but excellent sections on some basics of workflow which we’ll be following throughout the course.</p>
