title: "Readings for week 5: Population Dynamics:
---

In this section we will explore introduce more aspects of R programming including functions, vectors, iteration, and random number generation through applications to a few classic population dynamics models.

Please read all of [Section III: Program](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/program-intro.html) in R for Data Science; in particular the chapters on functions, vectors, and iteration.  Note that those of you already familiar with R programming may still find new material on iteration using the `purrr` package from `tidyverse` informative.   

As usual, you need not master all the material here, but try to become familiar with what is discussed where so you can refer to it quickly later on.  There's a lot of R fundamentals condensed down to there essentials in these chapters.

On the ecological population dynamics side, our emphasis will be on simulation, though many of the models we will start off with are amiable to analytic treatment.  I strongly encourage interested students to take a look at the [Population Biology Concepts & Models](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4757-2731-9) for a gentle introduction. (You can access an electronic copy through campus network or vpn, <doi:10.1007/978-1-4757-2731-9>).
