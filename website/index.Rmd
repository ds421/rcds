## Course Description

This course provides an introduction to principles and tools for
reproducible and collaborative data science; including data curation
and cleaning, version control, virtual machines, scripted work flow,
hypothesis-driven exploratory data analysis, data visualization,
and communication. Students will be introduced to git, Python, R,
and LaTeX. The class will navigate a series of problem-driven
analyses, focused on case studies and independent projects, leading to
reproducible products that allow updated analyses as new data become
available. Projects by first year trainees will be presented at the
Annual Symposium.

## Approach

This course will use a [flipped classroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom) model, with new material
introduced in reading assignments prior to class while class time will
focus on applying these skills to explore interesting data sets. We
will move though four modules, each introducing a new data set and
new scientific questions, while also introducing a new skill area and 
building on previous skills. Students will be expected to work collaboratively
in and out of class, and course content and grading will emphasize
communication and reproducibility of an analysis as much as scientific
or technical completeness.  The [Course Syllabus](https://ds421.github.io/rcds/syllabus.html)
provides an overview of the modules and topics covered as well as links
to weekly reading, assignments, and any lecture material.  This syllabus
is preliminary and always subject to change.

## Texts

We will use [Grolemund and Wickham's *R For Data Science*](http://amzn.to/2aHLAQ1) 
as the primary text for this course. A hard copy of the book is not
required and the openly licensed full text can be found on the [author's website for this book](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/).

Students will also be referred to sections in [Wickham's *Advanced R*](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/) for more on 
fundamentals of R programming, as well as various other references as necessary.
