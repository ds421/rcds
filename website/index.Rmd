This course provides an introduction to principles and tools for
reproducible and collaborative data science; including data curation
and cleaning, version control, virtual machines, scripted work flow,
hypothesis-driven exploratory data analysis, data visualization,
and communication. Students will be introduced to git, Python,R,
and LaTeX. The class will navigate a series of problem-driven
analyses, focused on case studies and independent projects, leading to
reproducible products that allow updated analyses as new data become
available. Projects by first year trainees will be presented at the
Annual Symposium.
