Students are required to provide their own laptops and to install free
and open source software on those laptops. 

# R

Install `R`, `RStudio` and the `tidyverse` suite of R packages, [as described here](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html#prerequisites).

# Git / GitHub

Register for a [GitHub](https://github.com) account and install `git`.  See [Happy Git With R](http://happygitwithr.com/) for instructions on installing `git` and configuring things so `git` can communicate with `RStudio`.
